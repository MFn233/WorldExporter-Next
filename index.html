    <hr>
    <p>the mobile version of Minecraft Bedrock Edition gives the user a choice of where their worlds should be kept. <b>"External"</b> and
        <b>"Application"</b>.</p>
    <p>"External" saves worlds in the device storage where the user can easily transfer them to another device.
        "Application" stores the worlds internally in Minecraft's private folder to which <b>only Minecraft has access</b>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Many people believe that rooting device is the only method of exporting worlds saved under "Application".
        <b>However, this is not true!</b></p>
    <p>You can use this program to export worlds from Android Minecraft Bedrock Edition if your "Storage Type" is set to
        "Application" in Minecraft Settings. The whole process is very simple and can be finished in under five minutes.
        <b>Your device does NOT need to be rooted!</b></p>

    <hr>
    <h4 id="requirements">REQUIREMENTS</h4>
    <p>To use WorldExporter, you will need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A computer running <b>Windows</b></li>
        <li><b>Java</b> installed on the Computer</li>
        <li>A <b>USB Cable</b> to connect to your phone / tablet</li>
        <li>About <b>five minutes</b> and <b>some patience</b></li>
    </ul>

    <hr>
    <h4 id="functions">FUNCTIONS</h4>
    <p>The program utilizes <a href="http://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb">ADB</a>'s backup feature
        which allows for copying an application's data even without root privileges. However, the exported backup file
        is encrypted so <a href="http://github.com/nelenkov/android-backup-extractor">Android Backup Extractor</a> is
        used to extract its contents into a tar archive. 7zip is then used to unarchive the tar file, and finally, the
        minecraftWorlds folder is moved to the WorldExporter's directory where it can be easily accessed by the user.
    </p>
    <p>The only user interaction required is the enabling of USB Debugging in Android settings. Instructions for doing
        this are included in the program.</p>
    <p>The code for the original program is open-source and is available on <a
            href="https://github.com/Tikolu/WorldExporter">GitHub</a>.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the code of this fork version is also open-source and is available on <a 
            href="https://github.com/MFn233/WorldExporter-Next">GitHub</a>.</p>
